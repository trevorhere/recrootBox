## Installation

2. Clone the repository locally
3. Open `recrootBox/src/ProfileInformation.js` and follow instructions in this file to add your information including your bio, image links, project titles, project links, etc.

## Deploying the portfolio

#### Previously, I recommended using github pages to host the project. Recently, I've found [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to be easier to use. 

### Netlify

1. Create a new site in netlify. 
2. Link this site to the recrootBox repo that you forked. 
3. In netlify deploy settings, specify `/build` as the content directory
4. In netlify deploy settings, specify `npm i && npm run build` as the deploy command
